We've received Scintillators from [Alexander Gektins group](http://isma.kharkov.ua/eng/).
According to Alexander, they are

> composite scintillator[s] on the base of the same CsI(Tl) or CsI(Na).
> It looks like a thin film made from optical (gel matrix) uploaded with scintillator (in your case it is CsI) powder.

These scintillators have been assessed with a classic [x-ray setup](https://www.psi.ch/bz/infrastruktur) (Varian RAD 14 source) at the [PSI radiation safety school](https://www.psi.ch/bz/schule-fuer-strahlenschutz).

The [iPython notebook](http://jupyter.org/) here shows the comparison of the different ISMA scintillators with a [classic CsI:Tl scintillator, commercially available from Toshiba](http://drive.globaldiagnostix.org/index.php/s/5gk1jXxG3M4yKEV).
